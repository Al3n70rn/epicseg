Description: EpiCSeg (Epigenome Count-based Segmentation) is a software for
    annotating the genome based on the state of the chromatin. It provides
    tools for extracting count data from BAM files, typlically corresponding
    to ChIP-seq experiments for histone marks (but other choices are possible)
    it learns a statistical model for the read counts based on a HMM,
    it annotates the genome, and it provides tools for displaying
    and analyzing the obtained models and segmentations. EpiCSeg can be used
    as an R package or from the command line via Rscript.
